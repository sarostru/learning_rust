# Some Notes in addition to the code

* Blogpost on using the [Option type in rust] (http://hoverbear.org/2014/08/12/option-monads-in-rust/)
 * The comments on the [related reddis thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2dnx7k/exploring_the_option_monad_with_rust/) explain something that I was finding confusing.  Rust doesn't have the generic Monad support like Haskell apparently due to a limitation in the current compiler implementation.
* [Macros] (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/macros.html) in the rust book
* [Syntax Extensions] (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/compiler-plugins.html) look useful.
 * The roman numeral macro example is nice too
